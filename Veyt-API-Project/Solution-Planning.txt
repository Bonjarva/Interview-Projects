Build a RESTful API in C# or Rust and deploy it to fly.io (It is free cloud service)

Use the dataset below:

https://github.com/GreenfactAS/co2-dataset

The api should return:

1. Top 10 Countries with highest Co2Emissions perCapita
2. Return CO2Emissions and YearlyChange given a list of country codes (Ex,: can,lux,est)
3. Top 10 Countries with highest LifeExpectancy
4. Total of Emissions given a list of countries codes (Ex,: can,lux,est)
5. Healthy Check Status - When you execute the application and navigate to /health endpoint, it will return the text “Healthy” as a response assuming that your application is up and running fine.



The API will have 5 end points as stated in the question:
1. url/t10CountriesHighCo2PerCapita
    Get request for Top 10 Countries with highest Co2Emissions perCapita
2. url/co2EmissionYearlyChange
    POST request, given the list of country codes (Need to check what format the list will come in as in parameter)
    return Co2 Emissions and YearlyChange for given countries
3. url/t10CountriesHighLifeExpectancy
    GET request, returns top 10 countries with highest life expectancy
4. url/totalEmissions
    POST request, given the list of country codes (Need to check what format the list will come in as in parameter)
    return total emissions
5.  url/health
    Returns "Healthy" if active
    Returns "Inactive" if not functional
